## Introduction

This presentation is to introduce the Shiny App built for Data Science Capstone final project. 

The goal of this app is to make next word prediction based on the input words. We first built a corpus from the text selected from files provided by Swifkey including blogs, news, and twitters. Then N-gram nature language processing was used to build the predictive model.


## Progress to Build Shinny App

- Downloading the data from the source: "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip"
- Select proper sample data and clean the data. This is very important for future data processing since the original text data is unstructured.
- Build corpus and N-gram and save to files.
- The user input terms are extracted from the N-Grams and sorted according to the frequency in descending order, to predict the next possible words.
- BUild the Shiny App to achieve our goal.
